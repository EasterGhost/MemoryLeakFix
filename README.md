# memoryLeakFix  
### A mod that fixes multiple memory leaks in minecraft. Both server-side & client-side  
  
For the best performance & memory usage, I recommend using this mod with:  
- [lazydfu](https://github.com/astei/lazydfu) - Makes startup much faster by not loading DFU until needed, also saves on memory  
- [lithium-fabric](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric) - The best general performance mod  
- [starlight](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight) - Re-write of the light engine to be blazing fast  
- [FerriteCore](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore) - Memory usage optimizations
