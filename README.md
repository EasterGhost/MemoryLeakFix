# memoryLeakFix
### A mod that fixes multiple memory leaks in minecraft. Both server-side & client-side

For best performance & memory usage, I recommend using these mod with:

- [lazydfu](https://github.com/astei/lazydfu) - Makes startup much faster by not loading DFU until needed, also saves on memory
- [lithium-fabric](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric) - The best general performance mod
- [hydrogen-fabric](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/hydrogen-fabric) - A memory based optimization mod
- [starlight](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight) - Re-write of the light engine to be blazing fast
